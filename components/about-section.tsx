                With over 5 years of experience in web development and design, I specialize in creating digital
                experiences that are both visually stunning and highly functional. My journey began with a fascination
                for how design and technology could work together to solve real-world problems.

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
                I believe that great websites are born from the perfect balance of beautiful design, clean code, and
                user-centered thinking. Whether it's a sleek corporate website or a dynamic web application, I approach
                every project with creativity, attention to detail, and a commitment to excellence.
              </p>

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
                When I'm not coding or designing, you'll find me exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source
                projects, or mentoring aspiring developers in my local community.
